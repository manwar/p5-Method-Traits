Revision history for Perl extension Method-Traits

0.04 2017-05-08
    [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE]
    - traits now get the MOP::Method instance instead
      of only the name, this means all trait code will
      need to be re-written to handle this, no attempt
      at back compat will be made.
        - I did tell you in 0.03 that things were still
          in flux
        - So you really only have yourself to blame
        - updated tests and docs accordingly

0.03 2017-02-23
    - added a warning to the docs about things
      still being in a state of flux
    - handle the string 'undef' in trait, convert
      it into proper undef value
        - added tests for this

0.02 2017-02-14
    - Improved parsing of multi-line attributes
    - switch test to use JSON::PP, which is core
    - specify the need for Perl 5.14.5 as minimum version
        - explain this in the docs

0.01 2017-02-07
    - Initial release to an unsuspecting world
