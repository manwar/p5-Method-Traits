=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use decorators ':for_providers';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a decorator provider which contains some useful decorators
for people who are writing decorator providers.

=head1 DECORATORS

=head2 Decorator

This is a C<TagMethod> meant to mark a subroutine as a Decorator. This
decorator much be attached to a subroutine if you want it to be considered
as a decorator by the system.

=head2 CreateMethod

This means that the decorator handler will create the method exclusivily.
This means the method must be a bodyless method. Ideally there is only one
C<CreateMethod> decorator attached to the method and it is the first one
that is executed. If this is not the case, the decorator will likely fail
to be applied.

=head2 WrapMethod

This means that the decorator handle will override, or wrap, the method.
This means the method must exist already.

=head2 TagMethod

This means that the decorator is really just a tag added to the method.
These typically will be processed at runtime through introspection, so
can simply be no-op subroutines. As with C<WrapMethod> this means the
method must exist already.
